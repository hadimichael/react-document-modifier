## Features

* Can modify any property on `window.document`;
* Like a normal React component, can use its parent's `props` and `state`;
* Can be defined in many places throughout the application;
* Supports arbitrary levels of nesting, so you can define app-wide and page-specific modifications;

```
npm install --save react-document-modifier
```

Dependencies: 

* react >= 0.14.0
* react-side-effect >= 1.0.0

## Usage/Examples
